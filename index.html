            Cricket is characterised as a batter’s game by many people because of the aid that they receive from training, favourable pitches, and brand-new powerful bats [Reference Neocore bats].
            Bowlers can often find themselves putting in huge effort and being smashed about the park. The most recent example of this is the first test match of England against Pakistan in our most
            recent tour of Pakistan where England’s batters were able to score 823 for the loss of seven wickets. For perspective, this was the fourth highest ever team score in an innings. [Ref ESPN cricinfo]
            Scores like these may provide a spectacle for the sheer feat of the batters to carry on for 10 hours in the Pakistani heat. However, it failed to make a contest between batters and bowlers. 
            Matches like these are what threaten the existence of test match cricket as people will not want to go and watch 2 men dominate a team of despairing fielders.

        When in England right arm fast bowlers typically look to swing the ball or in other words create lateral movement in the air to make batting more difficult and to take more wickets. The most common
        form of lateral movement is outswing to a right-handed batter. This is created when the ‘seam’ (stitched part of the ball which joins the two halves of the ball) is pointed towards 1st slip
        (a fielding position to the left of the keeper behind the stumps) and the rough side of the ball is on the side away from the batter. [Reference practical perspective of cricket ball swing]. 
        The effect of this is to move the ball away from the batter, because of the turbulent airflow created on the rough side, slowing the ball down and pulling it to the left; giving this form of 
        lateral movement the name ‘outswing’.  Bowlers hope to take wickets (get the batter out) by finding the outside edge of the batter using this form of swing as the ball is moving away from this 
        edge of the bat. This is why commonly you can see 3 or 4 ‘slip’ fielders behind the batter at the start of a test innings. [Reference Talksport article]
