            Cricket is characterised as a batter’s game by many people because of the aid that they receive from training, favourable pitches, and brand-new powerful bats [Reference Neocore bats].
            Bowlers can often find themselves putting in huge effort and being smashed about the park. The most recent example of this is the first test match of England against Pakistan in our most
            recent tour of Pakistan where England’s batters were able to score 823 for the loss of seven wickets. For perspective, this was the fourth highest ever team score in an innings. [Ref ESPN cricinfo]
            Scores like these may provide a spectacle for the sheer feat of the batters to carry on for 10 hours in the Pakistani heat. However, it failed to make a contest between batters and bowlers. 
            Matches like these are what threaten the existence of test match cricket as people will not want to go and watch 2 men dominate a team of despairing fielders.
