            Cricket is characterised as a batter’s game by many people because of the aid that they receive from training, favourable pitches, and brand-new powerful bats [Reference Neocore bats].
            Bowlers can often find themselves putting in huge effort and being smashed about the park. The most recent example of this is the first test match of England against Pakistan in our most
            recent tour of Pakistan where England’s batters were able to score 823 for the loss of seven wickets. For perspective, this was the fourth highest ever team score in an innings. [Ref ESPN cricinfo]
            Scores like these may provide a spectacle for the sheer feat of the batters to carry on for 10 hours in the Pakistani heat. However, it failed to make a contest between batters and bowlers. 
            Matches like these are what threaten the existence of test match cricket as people will not want to go and watch 2 men dominate a team of despairing fielders.

        When in England right arm fast bowlers typically look to swing the ball or in other words create lateral movement in the air to make batting more difficult and to take more wickets. The most common
        form of lateral movement is outswing to a right-handed batter. This is created when the ‘seam’ (stitched part of the ball which joins the two halves of the ball) is pointed towards 1st slip
        (a fielding position to the left of the keeper behind the stumps) and the rough side of the ball is on the side away from the batter. [Reference practical perspective of cricket ball swing]. 
        The effect of this is to move the ball away from the batter, because of the turbulent airflow created on the rough side, slowing the ball down and pulling it to the left; giving this form of 
        lateral movement the name ‘outswing’.  Bowlers hope to take wickets (get the batter out) by finding the outside edge of the batter using this form of swing as the ball is moving away from this 
        edge of the bat. This is why commonly you can see 3 or 4 ‘slip’ fielders behind the batter at the start of a test innings. [Reference Talksport article]

        Bowlers can also look to create lateral movement back into a right-handed batter by flipping the ball, so the seam and rough side of the ball are now pointed to the right side of the wicket keeper.
        This will cause the ball to come back into the batter as the rough side creates more turbulent air flow than the ‘shiny’ side, which slows the rough side and pulls the ball across the batter. 
        [Reference practical perspective of cricket ball swing]. This lateral movement has the name ‘inswing’. For the bowler they will hope to either bowl the batter (hit the stumps) or bring LBW into play, 
        where if it hits the batter on the leg and it is adjudged by the umpire to have gone on to hit the stumps if it had not hit the batter’s leg first [Reference Olympics article].  

        For left-handed batters, the terms ‘inswing’ and ‘outswing’ are flipped however the methods of creating the swing are the same. 

        As a cricket ball ages and is hit by the bat multiple times it will deteriorate causing it to misshape and rough up each side. To create one shiny and one rough side (and therefore swing) players ‘shine’ 
        the ball when they rub the less rough side up and down clothing. It has been found that sweat and sylvia can be used to improve the ‘shine’ of the ball (how smooth and shiny it looks) which increases swing. 
        [Reference practical perspective of cricket ball swing]. The balls that are used in England and the West Indies are Dukes balls which are intended to swing for up to 80 overs. However, recently the Dukes balls
        have been going out of shape relatively quickly which has prevented swing occurring throughout the life of the ball (80 overs minimum) and has resulted in the ball being swapped for a different ball which is
        in a better condition because the new ball is hit out of shape of being able to pass through the mandatory size rings. [Reference BBC article]

        Typically for Kookaburra balls which are used everywhere else in the world except for India, it will swing for the opening overs. The time it swings varies depending on the country. For example, in Pakistan it 
        can be expected to swing for the opening 20-30 overs, this leads to spin bowlers being used in excess typically in the ‘Subcontinent’ (Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) also because the pitches are 
        much drier and dustier in Asia which makes spinners be able to turn the ball much more off the surface. [Reference EPSN swing article].

        Faster bowlers come into use in the subcontinent often over halfway through the life of a ball, when it begins to ‘reverse swing’. This is when the ball has one very rough side and one side which is kept in
        a better condition by shining it. To create this, swing the seam and rough side is pointed away from your intended direction of swing. Where with conventional swing this would swing towards the rough side,
        instead it will swing the opposite direction because an area of low pressure is created on the shinier side of the ball. [Reference MPL article] This proves very difficult for the batters to play as they
        expect the opposite direction of movement, thus still making fast bowlers key in Asia.
